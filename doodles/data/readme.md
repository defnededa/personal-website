--THE EVOLUTION OF TRUST, NICKY CASE, https://ncase.me/trust/--

### Main argument this essay is making

--Nicky Case's "The Evolution of Trust" explores the dynamics of trust in social interactions, using game theory as a basis. It discusses how trust is built, broken, and the conditions under which individuals decide to trust or betray each other.--

### Outline

--P1: Introduces the concept of trust and its importance in human relationships. Also introduces a trust-based game where players choose to either cooperate by putting in a coin, which benefits the other player, or cheat by not contributing.
P2: Introduction to Strategy and Uncertainty: Describes playing against different opponents with varying strategies in an uncertain number of rounds, emphasizing the dilemma of trust.
P3 - Tournament of Characters with Distinct Strategies: Introduces a tournament setting where characters with different strategies, like Copycat, Always Cheat, and others, compete, prompting the player to predict the winner.
P4 - Evolution Through Competition and Adaptation:Explains a process where characters evolve by playing in tournaments, eliminating the least successful, and replicating the strategies of the winners, illustrating cultural evolution.
P5 - The Evolution of Distrust: Presents a scenario starting with cooperative characters, introducing one Always Cheat and one Copycat, to explore the emergence of distrust.
P6 - Making Mistakes and Their Impact: Discusses the introduction of errors in the trust game and provides tools to simulate and observe the consequences.
P7 - Key Factors for the Evolution of Trust: Outlines the three essential elements for trust to evolve in game theory: repeat interactions, potential for mutual benefit, and low miscommunication, while acknowledging the complexity of real-world trust dynamics.-

### Title, author and link

--"Fireflies", Nicky Case, https://ncase.me/fireflies/ --

### Main argument this essay is making

--The essay "Fireflies" explores the phenomenon of synchronous flashing in fireflies, emphasizing how individual, small-scale interactions can lead to large-scale organization and synchronization. It highlights that each firefly operates on its own internal clock, and through simple interactions with nearby fireflies, a collective harmony emerges, demonstrating a principle of self-synchronization that applies to various natural and technological systems.--

### Outline

-- P1: Introduction to Fireflies' Magic: Describes the enchanting visual of fireflies lighting up in synchrony and introduces the mystery of their coordinated flashing.
P2: Historical Context and Research: Mentions the skepticism faced by scientists studying fireflies and sets the stage for explaining their findings.
P3: Mechanism of Synchronization: Explains that fireflies do not follow a leader but synchronize through individual interactions, nudging their internal clocks upon seeing another flash.
P4: Observation and Patterns: Describes the process of synchronization, from initial randomness to small groups flashing together, then waves, and finally full synchrony.
P5: Resilience of the Synchronization: Shows that even when disrupted, the fireflies can re-synchronize, demonstrating the robustness of their collective behavior.
P6: Interactive Elements: Includes interactive features such as turning on the sync, sliders for changing the number of firefiles etc for users to play with virtual fireflies, further illustrating the concept of synchronization.
P7: Broader Implications:Connects the fireflies' synchronization to other natural and technological phenomena, emphasizing the universal principle of self-synchronization.
P8: Conclusion and Reflection: Encourages the reader to reflect on the impact of small-scale interactions, drawing a parallel between fireflies and human influence. --

### What worked well in this?

--Engaging Narrative: The essay effectively uses storytelling to draw the reader into the mystery and beauty of fireflies' synchronized flashing.
Interactive Demonstrations: The inclusion of interactive elements allows readers to experiment with the concepts, enhancing understanding and engagement. --

## Your essay

### What is your essay about?

--The essay explores the fascinating world of Crayola crayon colors, focusing on how they are categorized and perceived. It delves into the science and art behind naming crayon colors and the challenges in aligning mathematical categorization with human color perception. --

### Where did you get your data? (link or source)

--Corpora: https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/colors/crayola.json --

### Where did this data come from originally? Who collected it?

-- It is the colors of Crayola, thus, Crayola the company. --

### What information is in your data? (relevant fields, metadata, etc)

--The data includes a list of Crayola crayon colors from the 120-count box, each with its name and corresponding hex color code. This provides a basis for both categorization and visual representation. --

### How many sections do you have?

--3: introduction and representation of colors, explaining grouping of colors with interactive buttons, an interactive memorization game to end.--
