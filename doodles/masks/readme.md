# A8: Masks

### Your Glitch link

-- You can find this on my website : https://www.defnededa.com/doodles/masks but my glitch is defnededa --

### Two techniques from A3-A7 and how you used them here

--I used 2 brushes from A3: the random pink emoji brush for cute mask's hands and heart brush for the eyes of cute mask. --

### Which was your favorite mask that you made, and why?

-- The cute mask because I really like pink and hearts. -

# Mask 1

### Describe this mask

--The "naturemask" is a digital, interactive mask with a nature theme. It overlays nature-inspired elements like plant emojis on the user's facial and hand landmarks, dynamically changing in response to movement. --

### What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

--Hand Size: To adjust the visual impact of hand animations.
Background Hue: Allows customization of the mask's background color for aesthetic preference.
Background Saturation: Enables users to modify the intensity of the background color for different visual effects.--

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

--For the hands, plant emojis and ellipses are animated over landmarks, changing size to mimic natural growth. The environment's adjustable hue and saturation complement the nature theme, creating a cohesive experience. --

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

--Secondary motion includes changing sizes of hand elements and independent movements of facial features, like butterfly contours. These motions respond to but are distinct from the primary movements tracked by the mask, adding depth to the interaction. --

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

--This mask fits the categories of "mask" and "environment." It alters the user's appearance like a traditional mask and creates an immersive, nature-themed ambiance. --

# Mask 2

### Describe this mask

--The "cutemask" is a neon-themed and pink digital mask with playful elements like emojis and hearts, designed to be visually appealing and whimsical. --

### What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

--Background Light: Adjusts background luminosity for different atmospheric effects.
Center Width: Changes the width of the mask's central neon line for customization.
Emoji List: Allows selection of emojis for hand landmarks for personalization.--

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

--The hands are highlighted with neon colors and emojis, enhancing expressiveness and interactivity. --

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

--The secondary motion in the "cutemask" involves the bright contours and emoji animations extending beyond the facial points, possibly around the hands or in the immediate background. These elements respond to facial movements, creating a dynamic and interactive aura that surrounds the user. This feature enhances the mask's engagement by adding a layer of motion that is influenced by, but not confined to, the facial expressions and movements. --

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

--This mask fits into the mask and environment categories, overlaying the face with expressive elements and extending its influence to the surrounding area for an immersive experience.--
