### Your Glitch(etc) link

-- https://www.defnededa.com/doodles/spaces --

### Which is your best space?

--clouds because they are really cute --

---

## Space 1

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

-- It is a strawberry field- strawberries of different sizes, colors and seeds grow there. --

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

-- Strawberry color: controls the color of the strawberry
Height: controls the height of the strawberry as a whole
Width: controls the width of the strawberry as a whole
stemcolor: controls the color of the stem
Seedcolor: controls the color of the strawberry seeds
seedcount: controls the number of seed on a strawberry --

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

--no green strawberries! --

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

-- continuous --

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

-- small strawberry: it is the smallest strawberry
big strawberry: it is the biggest strawberry
pineberry: different variety of strawberry
simpleberry: no seeds kinda weird
activeberry: a lot of seeds do a dance it is cool --

## Space 2

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

-- Clouds! it makes different smiling clouds. --

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

--cloudcolor: controls color of the cloud
height: controls height of the cloud
width: controls width of the cloud
happiness: controls the height of the smile
eyecolor: controls the color of the eyes
mouthcolor: controls the color of the mouth --

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

--No rain, no sad clouds. They are all happy, just different levels. It is a utopia. --

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

--continuous --

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

--Small cloud and big cloud show the limits of sizing. The crazy, crazier and calm cloud are just fun!! --

---

## Space 3

### What kinds of things does this space make?:

--It is an alien family. --

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

--skincolor: controls skin color
eyecolor: controls eye color
haircolor: controls hair color
size: controls alien's face size
eyesize: controls size of the eyes
mouthcolor: controls the color of the mouth --

### What expected kinds of these things are _not_ in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

--They are a family so they look very much like each other. No aliens of different races, lacks on the diversity part :/--

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

-continuous--

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

--small and big alien show size limits. mother alien, father alien and granny alien are just family members you should meet. --

---

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

-- I really improved my RGB skills. Also, patience. --

### Glitch handles of people in class you got help from, and their help, (or help you gave!)

-- melisaozdoyuran2024 helped me understand using sliders--

### Assets you got from online and why you have permission to include them

-- N/A --

### Online help, including ChatGPT

-- p5 js documentary and ChatGPT. ChatGPT was particularly useful with debugging, explaining the starter code to me, and with math calculations.--
