# A3: Drawing Tools

## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?

--I want the user to feel the joy of the colors! I love pink and I think everyone could appreciate a little bit more pink in their life!!! --

## Describe your eraser. What does it do?

--My eraser sets the background to rainbow gradient, but you can further erase the rainbow via dragging the mouse. --

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?

--The first tool is labeled as "blobs 1". It is a discrete brush that creates blob-like shapes on the canvas To use the tool, the user drags the mouse across the canvas. As the mouse is dragged, blobs are created at the mouse's position, which then move and grow organically, creating a unique effect. The color of the blobs is determined by the color0 parameter, and their transparency varies, giving them a magical look.--

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

--The first tool is labeled as "blobs 1". It is a discrete brush that creates blob-like shapes on the canvas To use the tool, the user drags the mouse across the canvas. As the mouse is dragged, blobs are created at the mouse's position, which then move and grow organically, creating a unique effect. The color of the blobs is determined by the color1 parameter, and their transparency varies, giving them a magical look. --

## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?

--This tool is labeled as "hearts". It is a discrete brush designed to draw pink heart shapes on the canvas. The tool utilizes the drawHeart function, which employs the beginShape(), endShape(), and bezierVertex() functions from p5.js to draw a heart shape. --

## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?

--The luck rainbow is designed to draw a continuous, curvy rainbow line on the canvas. The tool then uses the beginShape(), curveVertex(), and endShape() functions from p5.js to draw a continuous, curvy line that passes through all the recorded points. The color of the line at each point is determined by the color assigned to that point, creating a rainbow effect as the colors transition between color0 and color1.
--

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?

-- Through my luck rainbow tool a continuous rainbow-colored line is drawn, following the path of the mouse. The line is curvy and smoothly transitions between points, and its color varies along its length, creating a dynamic and vibrant rainbow effect. --

## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?

--One tool that uses beginshape/ endshape is my hearts tool, and my hearts tool uses drawHeart function which creates a heart through begin and end shape. --

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

-- I think I am getting better at p5 and js, I also had never done brushes before so working on that was really interesting! --

### Glitch handles of people in class you got help from, and their help, (or help you gave!)

-- N/A --

### Assets you got from online and why you have permission to include them

-- Emojis: Apple says" The specific design of emojis is copyrighted as font or work of art. The emoji as included with software are for your own personal, non-commercial use."--

### Online help, including ChatGPT

-- I got help from p5js documentation and ChatGPT. ChatGPT was particularly useful with debugging, explaining the starter code to me, and with my blobs. --
