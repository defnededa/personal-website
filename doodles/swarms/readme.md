### Which systems behaved like you expected? Which ones surprised you? In which ones did your initial idea evolve into something different?

-- I though using a perlin flow would be harder to do, and decorating the particles would be easier. My "art" idea evolved into "flow".--

### Describe your 1st system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior? What debug draw info and controls did you add?

--
The first system is named "trail" and its primary function is to create trailing particles that interact with each other based on alignment, cohesion, and separation forces.
Force:
Alignment: This force causes a particle to align its direction with the average direction of its neighbors.
Cohesion: This force causes a particle to move towards the average position of its neighbors, creating a cohesive group movement.
Separation: This force causes a particle to move away from its neighbors if they are within a certain distance, preventing overcrowding.
The combination of these three forces results in a flocking behavior where particles move in a cohesive group while maintaining a certain distance from each other.When the drawDebugInfo flag is true, the system will draw an arrow representing the velocity of each particle. This helps to visualize the direction and speed of each particle's movement.
Controls:
Trail Length: This control allows the user to adjust the length of the trail behind each particle.
Spawn Rate: This control allows the user to adjust the rate at which new particles are spawned.

### Describe your 2nd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior? What debug draw info and controls did you add?

--The second system is named "bouncing" and its primary function is to create bouncing balls that interact with each other and the boundaries of the frame.
Forces:
Bounce off Walls: This force causes a ball to reverse its velocity when it hits the boundary of the frame, creating a bouncing effect.
Bounce off Each Other: This force causes balls to bounce off each other when they come into contact. The direction and magnitude of the force are calculated based on the distance and direction between the two balls.
The combination of these forces results in a dynamic system where balls bounce around the frame, colliding with each other and the walls.
When the drawDebugInfo flag is true, the system will draw a line representing the velocity of each ball. This helps to visualize the direction and speed of each ball's movement.
Controls:
Ball Radius: This control allows the user to adjust the radius of the balls.
Ball Speed: This control allows the user to adjust the speed of the balls.

### Describe your 3rd system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior? What debug draw info and controls did you add?

--The third system is named "repulsion" and its primary function is to create particles that are repelled by the mouse cursor.
Force:
Mouse Repulsion: This force causes particles to be repelled by the mouse cursor when it is pressed. The direction of the force is away from the mouse cursor, and its magnitude is proportional to the mouseStrength parameter.
The combination of these forces results in a dynamic system where particles move away from the mouse cursor when it is pressed, creating a repulsion effect. The combination of these forces results in a dynamic system where particles move away from the mouse cursor when it is pressed, creating a repulsion effect.
Control:
Mouse Strength: This control allows the user to adjust the strength of the repulsion force exerted by the mouse cursor.
--

### Describe your 4th system. What forces does it use? What is its emergent behavior? What debug draw info and controls did you add?

-- The fourth system is named "flow" and its primary function is to create particles that follow a flow field generated by Perlin noise.
Force:
Flow Field: This force is generated by Perlin noise and causes particles to move in a direction determined by the noise value at their current position. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the noiseStrength parameter.
The combination of these forces results in a dynamic system where particles follow a flow field that changes over time, creating a fluid and organic motion. When the drawDebugInfo flag is true, the system will draw the flow field as a grid of arrows representing the direction of the flow at each point.
Control:
Noise Strength: This control allows the user to adjust the strength of the flow field, which affects the magnitude of the force acting on the particles. --

### Which system has one particle uses particle-to-particle interaction? Explain how.

--Bouncing! The balls bounce off of each other.--

### Which system has particles that leave a trail or creates new particles

--Trail! You can also adjust trail length. It autaomatically leaves a trail but also, I know dragging does not count but the trail it leaves behind when dragged is really cool regardless. --

### Which system interacts with user behavior, and how?

-- Repulsion! The particles are repulsed away from the mouse/user.--

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

-- Writing more complex js files. Creating js files myself. Perlin flows.--

### Glitch handles of people in class you got help from, and their help, (or help you gave!)

-- N/A--

### Assets you got from online and why you have permission to include them

-- N/A --

### Online help, including ChatGPT

-- I got help from p5js documentation and ChatGPT. ChatGPT was particularly useful with debugging, explaining the starter code to me, and with math calculations. I also looked at https://editor.p5js.org/ndeji69/sketches/EA17R4HHa for inspiration. --
