### Describe the 6 gifs you made, and what tools each used

--
Self Portrait: This GIF showcases a circle representing a face with two heart-shaped eyes that change their size in a loop. I used circle from p5. I did a drawHeart function to draw the eyes. I used ingpongEased function to create the looping effect for the eyes' size.

Looping Hearts: Multiple hearts are displayed in a grid-like pattern, all pulsating in size in a loop. I used a for loop, ratio'd the WIDTH and HEIGHT constants, utilized drawHeart and pingpongEased.

My Name Flying: The name "Defne" flies across the screen in a wave-like pattern, creating a trailing effect. I used the math module and text.

Raining Strawberries: Animated strawberries fall from the top of the screen in a staggered pattern, looping back to the top once they reach the bottom. Loop info is displayed as well. I used frameCount, loopLength, drawStrawberry and drawInformation.

Dancing Seeds: A large strawberry is displayed in the center of the canvas with its seeds appearing to dance or move. I did a drawStrawberry function which utilizes random and combines many shapes.-

Final Combo:A rotating strawberry is displayed in the center of the canvas, surrounded by floating hearts that change their size in a loop. I used drawStrawberry, drawHeart, pingpongeased and a for lopp.-

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

--I really like the bezier vertex because I got to make a heart and a strawberry with it.-

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

--I don't think so. --

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?

--For GIF 3, I set the border variable to 50 which created the illusion of strawberries fading away. I also had to figure out what map is. --

### Does the self-portrait "look like you"? What is missing? What worked well?

-- It looks like me on a postmodern level... I have a pretty circular face... It is so circle that people usually comment on it. And the green hearts as eyes represent my eyes and how loving I am<3 --

### What is one new skill that you gained during this project?

-- I definitely got better at Javascript and learnt P5. I would also say patience because the strawberry rain sure did challenge my patience.--
