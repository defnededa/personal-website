Complexifier 2: There is a mystical sound each time a fortune is told. --

## Look up the Gricean maxims. Do your bots obey them? Why or why not?

-- I would say they obey to quantity, relation and manner. Maybe not quality. It is upto discussion how legit card readings are. I also mention that the gossip produced is fake at the start, but technically it is still false information. --

Welcome to FortuneBot. Please pick a card from the deck (e.g., 'Ace of Hearts, 7 of Spades').

They say
I see new relationships, friendship. Pick another card to continue.
Then you pick another card.
