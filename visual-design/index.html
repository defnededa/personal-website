        My experience includes but is not limited to
        <span style="font-weight: 700">Adobe Creative Cloud</span> (Photoshop,
        Illustrator, and more), Procreate, Canva, and Figma. I have created
        visual designs for merch items, user interfaces, social media, as well

        I am passionate about
        <span style="font-weight: 700">creating brand identities,</span>
        including the color palette, typography, visual brand extensions such as
        iconography & reusable assets, setting the brand tone, and creation of
        primary/ secondary logos. Hence, I can also work under brand guidelines
        as needed.

          <h3>Logo Creation Work</h3>
          <p>
            I began working as a freelance designer and branding consultant as a
            rising sophomore. While I cannot share most of my work, you can find
            some examples of the logos I have designed here.

          <h3>Brand Books</h3>
          <p>
            In this section, you’ll find examples showcasing my work in graphic
            design and branding, including color palettes, typography, and brand
            guidelines.

          <h3>Moments of Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            In my free time, I love messing around with digital art and
            illustration. Each piece in the series forms part of a larger
            narrative, an evolution of feelings.

          <h3>Empowered Conversations</h3>
          <p>
            I designed the landing page and advised color choices for Empowered
            Conversations, an organization focused on destigmatizing sexual
            assault through conversations. Check the page out here.

          <h3>Doctor Smart</h3>
          <p>
            I wrote and illustrated a zine for children attending grades 3-5 of
            marginalized communities. It aims to both underscore the difference
            between unintended and unanticipated consequences, as well as
            inspire the students to learn STEM.

          <h3>Sketchbook: Handbag Designs</h3>
          <p>
            This collection of quick sketches represents my approach to
            conceptual design through sketching. Each design radiates a
            whimsical, playful energy, showcasing the power of sketching to
            communicate ideas with clarity and efficiency.
